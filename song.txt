I’m not strong enough to stay away.
Can't run from you
I just run back to you.
Like a moth im drawn into your flame,
Say my name, but it's not the same.
You look in my eyes I’m stripped of my pride.
And my soul surrenders
and you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin’ me when you're away,
i wanna leave and i wanna stay
I’m so confused,So hard to choose.
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right.
Even if i try to win the fight,
my heart would overrule my mind
And I’m not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do
i would die without you
in your presence my heart knows no shame
im not to blame
cause you bring my heart to its knees

And it's killin’ me when you're away,
i wanna leave and i wanna stay
I’m so confused,So hard to choose.
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right.
Even if i try to win the fight,
my heart would overrule my mind
And I’m not strong enough to stay away
There's nothing I can do
My heart is chained to you
And I can't get free
Look what this love did to me

And it's killin’ me when you're away,
i wanna leave and i wanna stay
I’m so confused,So hard to choose.
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right.
Even if i try to win the fight,
my heart would overrule my mind
And I’m not strong enough to stay away

not strong enough, strong enough
not strong enough, strong enough to stay away
not strong enough, strong enough
and im not strong enough to stay away
